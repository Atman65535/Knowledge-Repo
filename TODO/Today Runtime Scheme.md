# Accidental Pre-arranged Planning (NO BRAIN NEEDED)
## TASK 1 DS:Heap, Huffman, Dijkstra and Prim
- [ ] Heap and Huffman Implementation
	1. Build Heap instance
		- create an array.
		- [ ] if use max heap and min heap sort it, half finish
		- [ ] if upgrade your heap code to cpp template class, completely finish
	2. Huffman Compression
		- tally the frequency
		- build prefix complete binomial tree
		- [ ] if get key value mapping table and compress this markdown file, half finish
		- [ ] if get inverse mapping table and uncompress, if the output can be parsed by obsidian, finish.
- [ ] Dijkstra and Prim Implementation
	1. define a graph, randomly hand write. Positive or zero weight, ten node.
	2. Dijkstra from the second node
		- start, set distance infinity except source
		- find min length, update visit and distance to neighbors
		- until no unvisit.
		- [ ] if print path: distance and trace nodes, finish
	3. Prim
		- [ ] if find MST, use preorder traversal to print it, finish

# Accidental Pre-arranged Planning (MAYBE NEED SOME)
